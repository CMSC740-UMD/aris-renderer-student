# Distribution Transformation

!!! NOTE
    For each of the six distributions, include:
    1. Steps of derivation (how you compute the CDF and inverse). You can either:
        - Type LaTeX. You may find [the source of assignment 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMSC740-UMD/CMSC740-UMD.github.io/master/assignment2.md.html) a useful reference.
        - Write on paper. Take a photo, put it in the `assignment-2` folder, and include with `![](image.jpg)`. It can be draft-like, no need to be formal and organized.
    1. A screenshot of the `test_warp.ipynb` visualization of the sample points.

Your responses here...

!!! NOTE
    Include a screenshot of the `check_warp()` output.
