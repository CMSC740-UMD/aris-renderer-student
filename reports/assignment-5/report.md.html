# Reconstruct the Diffuse BRDFs of the Walls

!!! NOTE
    Include the visualizations at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 steps.

Replace this line with your responses.

# Loading the Trained Models and Rendering Them

!!! NOTE
    Include the spp=128 rendering of your trained model. Then, include the albedo renderings at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 steps.

Replace this line with your responses.

# Limiting Path Length

!!! NOTE
    Include the albedo renderings at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 steps.

    How do they look compared to ground truth and previous results, and why?

Replace this line with your responses.

# Training Neural Radiosity

!!! NOTE
    Include the lhs and rhs images in the last visualization. In this case, what is the network learning (see how LHS is computed)?

Replace this line with your responses.

!!! NOTE
    (Optional) For this and the following parts, did you use a GPU and does it improve training speed?

Replace this line with your responses.

# Running Neural Radiosity

!!! NOTE
    Briefly describe how you compute RHS. Include the final lhs and rhs images.

Replace this line with your responses.

# Rendering Neural Radiosity

!!! NOTE
    Include the three rendered images as described in the assignment description.

Replace this line with your responses.

!!! NOTE
    Compare the speed of training and rendering between neural radiosity and path tracing (Part 1).
    **Depending on your code and environment, either can be faster, or they can have roughly the same speed.**
    Analyze, in your case, what may be contributing to the difference or similarity.

Replace this line with your responses.

# Other comments

!!! TIP
    Not required, does not affect grading, but appreciated.

!!! NOTE
    How long (a rough estimation is ok) did it take for you to finish this assignment? Was it difficult?
